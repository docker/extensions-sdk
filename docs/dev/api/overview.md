# Extension UI API

The extensions UI runs in a sandboxed environment and doesn't have access to any
electron or nodejs APIs.

The extension UI API provides a way for the frontend to perform different actions
and communicate with the Docker Desktop dashboard or the underlying system.

- [Backend](./backend.md)
- [Docker](./docker.md)
- [Dashboard](./dashboard.md)
- [Navigation](./dashboard-routes-navigation.md)

Find the Extensions API reference [here](./reference/README.md).
